    <h4><font size="5">Why choose to get clothes from a company that practices sustainable fashion? What are the benefits to both consumers and manufacturers?</h4>
    <p> - The production of sustainable fashion benefits consumers, manufacturers and the ecosystem as a whole. Firstly, it majorly helps decrease carbon footprint, chemical load, waste, water wastage, toxic chemicals and even requires less energy. Now, regarding consumers it could actually cost cheaper than fast fashion and at the same time make the consumers more aware about the environmental harm being done by any non-sustainable fashion product. Highlighting the manufacturers, it boosts the brand/companies image and how people perceive the company as compared to others. People should choose to get clothes from companies that practice sustainable fashion so other companies that follow fast fashion get in pursuit of shifting their ideology to sustainable fashion as well.</p>
