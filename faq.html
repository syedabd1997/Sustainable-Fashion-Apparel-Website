<p><a name="Question1"><font size="5">1) Sustainable Fashion is fashion that is classified to be environmentally friendly. In simpler words, it is the way to manufacture clothing by being friendly to the environment in terms of very less waste, and minimum use of chemicals and toxins that are threatening to the earth. </a></p>

<p><a name="Question2">2) Yes, because some major brands such as H&M are making steps in the Sustainable Fashion market. Since major brands are beginning to adopt this, that means consumers will be educated more on this topic, something that is already happening, and by creating more awareness of the problems our ecosystem faces, this which will increase the demand for the Sustainable Fashion Market, and others will very easily follow suit.</a></p>

<p><a name="Question3">3) The reason behind why everyone has not shifted towards buying Sustainable Fashion products is because in a lot of cases, there is not enough awareness as to why the Sustainable Fashion trend is being introduced, which automatically leads to people purchasing fast fashion products.</a></p>

<p><a name="Question4">4) Definitely, Yes! If people are thoroughly educated and informed regarding the benefits of Sustainable Fashion and the harmful effects of Fast Fashion, then people will definitely give more attention to sustainable products which could give Sustainable Fashion products a huge boost in regards to making a breakthrough into the mainstream. The reason Sustainable Fashion has not had an impactful breakthrough as of yet is because of peopleâ€™s lack of knowledge in regards to what harm we are doing to our Earth by excessively pursuing Fast Fashion clothes. If sustainable products come into the mainstream, then there is no reason why anyone would revert back to Fast fashion.</a></p>
